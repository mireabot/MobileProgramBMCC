Students will be engaged in dialogue about mobile applications, challenges, and career opportunities. The faculty mentor will invite alumni working in mobile programing and related fields to visit and present about their career trajectories and technical projects. Faculty will arrange a visit by the club to a local tech company and the students have a chance to meet with a complete mobile development team and understand their working environment, job responsibilities, work schedule, company culture and the future employers expectations. The visit will allow students to connect the classroom knowledge to real world problems and it will motivate students learning. Under the supervision of the faculty mentor, students will work on a small mobile development project that will be showcased by the CIS department</p>

            <p class="text-gray-500 text-base">BMCC is located at the heart of the Manhattan financial business district with many top 100 firms having offices in the area. BMCC and CIS department faculty have longstanding relationships with many of the education officers in these companies and there is a strong track record of partnering around student internships through the BMCC Office of Internships and Experiential Learning (OIEL). BMCC understands that professional internships and work experiences are at the heart of workforce training, and the staff of OIEL has agreed to support placement of mobile programming students in high quality industry internships either with Cognizant, the industry partner on this proposal, or with comparable NYC-based employers such as local non-profit organizations (HealthFirst, NYC Geospatial Information System and Mapping Org, etc.), tech and financial companies (Bank of New York, IBM and Bloomberg), or local IT companies (LarrosaTek). Given the number of collaborations between BMCC CIS faculty and the NYC tech sector, we do not foresee barriers to meeting our target metric for internship placement (at least 5 students each year from 2023-2025)</p>

These events will be open to high school students and teachers from the partner schools, enrolled BMCC students, faculty, and alumni. This exposure to the perspectives of industry experts will allow for valuable networking opportunities as well as student insight into challenges and career opportunities in the field</p>

Both enrolled BMCC students and high school students engaged in pipeline activities will be encouraged to attend and, where applicable, to showcase their work in a poster exhibit. This important professional networking event is already part of the BMCC calendar, and we will leverage it to ensure that students are exposed to professional networks and opportunities in secure mobile programming sector in NYC </p>

            <h3 class="flex items-center mb-2 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900">Attendance of Industry Conferences by Students</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-500 text-base">To broaden their exposure to mobile development, students who work with faculty in the Mobile Programming Club and/or have been placed in industry internships will be encouraged to submit a project abstract to at least one professional conference. If accepted, students will receive stipends to attend. Students who are not presenting but are keenly interested in attending will also be eligible for a stipend. BMCC has set the target of supporting at least 4 students each academic year in attending and/or presenting at a conference, where they will have opportunities to meet with industry professionals and researchers and to gain deeper understanding of mobile programming and real-world problems/solutions</p>
